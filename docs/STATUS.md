# Project Status & Development Progress

## üìä Current Status (September 2025)

**‚úÖ Architecture Refactoring Complete**
- Successfully migrated from Visual Effects to Generator-Effect-Renderer architecture
- Clean folder structure with tests co-located with components
- Arduino IDE compatibility maintained via `BlinkyArchitecture.h`
- Comprehensive documentation structure established

**‚úÖ Ready for Hardware Testing**
- All device configurations compile successfully  
- Memory usage efficient (12-13% flash, 4% RAM)
- Build system fully functional for all three device types
- Fire effect generates proper red colors (fixed green issue)

**‚è≥ Next Phase: Hardware Validation**
- Test all three configurations on actual XIAO nRF52840 Sense hardware
- Validate fire effects, audio responsiveness, and IMU functionality
- Comprehensive test suite validation via serial console

## üßπ Recent Cleanup & Organization

**Repository Cleanup Completed:**
- ‚úÖ All build artifacts removed (build-mbed/, build-working/, arduinotemp/)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced .gitignore covering Arduino builds, IDE files, OS files
- ‚úÖ Documentation moved to organized docs/ structure
- ‚úÖ Clean project root with only standard open source files

**Architecture Organization:**
- ‚úÖ Components separated into logical folders (generators/, effects/, renderers/)
- ‚úÖ Tests co-located with implementation code
- ‚úÖ Single include file for Arduino IDE compatibility
- ‚úÖ Professional folder structure following industry best practices

## üìã TODO (Priority Order)

### High Priority - Hardware Validation

- [ ] Test Hat config on actual hardware (89 LEDs, STRING_FIRE)
- [ ] Test Tube Light config on actual hardware (4x15 matrix, MATRIX_FIRE)  
- [ ] Test Bucket Totem config on actual hardware (16x8 matrix, MATRIX_FIRE)
- [ ] Verify all fire effects display correctly
- [ ] Validate audio responsiveness and IMU functionality

### Medium Priority - Runtime Features

- [ ] Add serial commands for device switching (`config hat`, `config tube`, etc.)
- [ ] Implement EEPROM configuration storage and persistence
- [ ] Add configuration profile system (save/load custom settings)
- [ ] Hardware auto-detection system (detect LED count/arrangement)

### Low Priority - Advanced Features  

- [ ] Configuration testing framework
- [ ] Enhanced error handling with LED status indicators
- [ ] Wireless configuration management (WiFi portal)
- [ ] Additional fire modes and effects
- [ ] Machine learning integration for adaptive parameters

See `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` for detailed remaining todo items and implementation phases.
