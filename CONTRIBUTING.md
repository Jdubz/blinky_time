## üõ† Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Comments**: Document complex algorithms and hardware-specific code
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when practical

### File Organization

- **Main sketch**: `blinky-things/blinky-things.ino`
- **Libraries**: Separate `.cpp/.h` files in main directory
- **Configurations**: Device-specific configs in `configs/` directory
- **Documentation**: Additional docs in `docs/` directory

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: add support for 8x8 matrix configuration
fix: correct zigzag mapping for tube lights
docs: update installation instructions for Windows
test: add battery monitoring validation
```

## üß™ Testing

### Hardware Testing

When contributing code changes:

1. **Test on actual hardware** when possible
2. **Verify all device types** if changes affect core functionality
3. **Check battery management** features with real battery usage
4. **Validate audio responsiveness** with various audio inputs

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles without warnings
- [ ] Fire effect displays correctly
- [ ] Audio responsiveness works as expected
- [ ] Battery monitoring functions properly
- [ ] Serial console commands respond correctly
- [ ] LED colors and brightness are accurate
